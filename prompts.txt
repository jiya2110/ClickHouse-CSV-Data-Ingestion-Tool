# Recorded Prompts for AI Interaction

1. Add a new endpoint to the Flask API service that logs requests and returns a JSON response with a welcome message. Ensure the log messages include request metadata like method and path.

2. Help me to create a set of prompts which you have recorded to be sent or checked into GitHub as a prompts.txt. Using AI add a few more.

3. Create a React component that displays a progress bar with customizable colors and animation speed.
